## Planning and development

1.  Come up with an idea for a full stack project!
1.  Designing the features by writing user stories and making frames.
1.  Developing the game by using the analysis and degign as input to write the
    code.
1.  Testing at various levels of development, and after.
1.  Bug fixing.

## Unsolved problems

-  The app is not mobile.
-  Initially the plan was to be able to swap CDs and records too over the app. But
-  I had to limit it to just books for now, to eliminate a table, and meet
   deadline.
-  Real-time chat to communicate with other users(hoping there is a third party
   API)
-  Making it available to buy books.
